# MinecraftstatCSV
output minecraft statistics to an alphabetized CSV file as well as dump to a readable alphabetized text document


This is a student project to output the statistics stored internally in minecraft to CSV format, alphabetized.  The file stored in the stats folder in a minecraft world is unformatted and unalphabetized, and minecraft itself does not allow searching stats or viewing them in alphabetical order.  The output is two files, a direct dump of the JSON file in a readable format to a txt file and the statistics viewed on the items tab in alphabetical order listed the same way as in game formatted in CSV format for easy viewing in any spreadsheet program.  This uses python's JSON parser.  a sample input and output are included
